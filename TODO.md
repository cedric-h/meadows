by sunday at 11:00 AM I want to have:

# TODAY:
good-looking worldgen
  - find meadow concept art
  - make meadow look good
  - grass
  - trees
  - TODO: roads
  - TODO: flowers

# MONDAY:

stickmen from multiple browser tabs walk around

/*
 * at this point, we have a beautiful little world with swaying plants and roads to walk around on with friends.
 * 
 * it's beautiful.
 * 
 * but it needs something more.
 * 
 * you need an excuse to spend time in this beautiful space.
 */

origin camp:
  - tents
  - campfire
  - pots
  - stickman with bouncing ! above head
  - interact, get some UI like 0/6 mushrooms collected
  - (add mushroom piles to worldgen?!)
  - collect six, report back to him, mission complete
  - ... make a shit ton more of these? this one sets the tone. ex: combat, fishing, baking!?



# WOULDN'T IT BE COOL IF ...

make minimap that pops out
  - show other players

use inventory ui from rpgc?

npc <-> npc dialogues
npc <-> player dialogues

"port" central area (&MA)
  - nice rolling clouds in background
  - harbor in the sky

omg omg character selection/equipment :scream:

graphics enhancements:
  - MSAA
  - bloom

eventually, we'll want things to persist: database, signup flow, all that good shit?
